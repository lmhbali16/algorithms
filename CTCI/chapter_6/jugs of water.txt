first we fill the five-quart jug then pour the water to the 3-quart jug.

So the 5-quart jug only has 2 quarts water in it.

Empty the 3-quart jug and pour the 2 quarts of water from the 5-quart jug to the 3-quart jug.

fill the 5-quart jug and using the water in the 5-quart jug fill the 3-quart jug with 1 quart of water so the 3-quart jug becomes full. That way, 4 quarts of water remains in the 5-quart jug
