probability of winning game 1 is p

probability of winning game 2 is (making two shots and missing one in three different variation + making all 3 shots)

p**2 (1-p) * 3 + p**3 = p**3 + 3p**2 - 3p**3 = 3p**2 - 2p**3

if game 2 wins we want

3p**2 - 2p**3 > p

3p - 2p**2 - 1 > 0

(1 - 2p)(p - 1) > 0

p must be p < 1

so (p - 1) < 0 and so (1 - 2p) < 0

p must be > 0.5 to have (1 - 2p)(p - 1) > 0
