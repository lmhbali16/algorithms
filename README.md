# Algorithms


This is a journey of practicing data sctucture and algorithm questions. The goal is to track my improvement of algorithm problem solving skills, and to note my own solution in case I want to revise some of the questions.

- The [CTCI](./CTCI) folder contains solutions for questions from the Crack The Coding Interview book.
- The [algorithm\_design\_class](./algorithm_design_class) contains some solutions to my Algorithm Design university tutorial questions.
- The [ds\_class](./ds_class) contains solutions to some of my Data Structure and Algorithm university tutorial questions.

Usually questions will be presented on the top of the files in comments.
